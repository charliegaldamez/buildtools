# Twentronix Build Tools
Twentronix Build Tools is an extension builder for Joomla!. It contains the common build files of the Twentronix extensions, but can also be used for building your own Joomla! extensions. Twentronix Build Tools is NOT a standalone builder, it needs an extension specific Phing build file.

Feel free to fork and contribute.
